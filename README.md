**Inspiration**
Medicines are something that many people take, but it becomes hard to keep track of them when someone is supposed to take many. Therefore, meet _daynamic_.

**What it does**
_daynamic_ allows individuals who are taking multiple medications to keep track of them on a daily basis. Users can enter their current medications and check them off.

**How I built it**
I utilized a tutorial to write the base dynamic calendar code with HTML and CSS. I then integrated the calendar + medicine tracker functionality using JavaScript.

**Challenges I ran into**
My website utilizes a lot of buttons and graphical elements which I had to make sure functioned properly as well as looked aesthetically pleasing to the eye.

**Accomplishments that I'm proud of**
I was able to make the website simplistic, user-friendly, and appealing to use.

**What I learned**
I learned how to work with HTML and CSS, as well as gaining more experience with JavaScript.

**What's next for _daynamic_**
The hope is that the medication list can be better integrated with the calendar so that users can look at their past medication intake on different days.
